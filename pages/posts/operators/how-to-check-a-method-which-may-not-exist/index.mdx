[Optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) allows you to access the value of a property located deep within a chain of objects which might currently be null or undefined.

<Code>{
`const user = { name: 'James', age: 24, country: 'UK', payment: {}};\n
const country = user?.country; // UK
const cardNumber = user?.payment?.card_number; // undefined
const isLogged = user?.login?.(); // undefined`
}</Code>
